  <h1>Meet vegantriathlete: A geocache hosted on the geocaching.com site.</h1>
  <p>Congratulations on finding the repository that gives you the information you need to find this cache!</p>
  <p>You will need to remember your Order of Operations to get the correct values below.</p>
  <p>[Seriously, don't tell me you are going to cheat and use a calculator.]</p>
  <p>A = 100/8-5/2+(4^2-9X2)-1</p>
  <p>B = -(3^3)-(-6^2)-6^1-1</p>
  <p>C = |2^2-3^2-1|</p>
  <p>D = 3/4+9/4+5^0+2^1</p>
  <p>E = 7^2-25X2+9^(1/2)</p>
  <p>F = (4X5-1+8)X3/3^2</p>
  <p>If you want to be really sneaky there is a hidden bonus. I've had to hide it on account of concerns around the
     rules and regulations for creating geoaches. Hmmm . . . where might you be able to search to find that information?
     Hint: You'll have to put on your "programmer" hat and think about how you use a certain programmer TOTT.</p>
  <p>Congratulations to the following geocachers who have gone the extra mile to complete the whole challenge!</p>
